This is a JS only app to serve SGD pages via the YeastMine database.

As a prototype it will serve the following pages:

/interactions/<gene>/
/references/genomewide/ { could be /references/<topic> }
and eventually
/regulation/<gene>  as this data gets loaded.
possibly
/regulation/by/<gene> and /regulation/of/<gene> or possibly even /regulates/<gene>/ and /regulators/<gene>

Backbone.js is used as the MVC framework, with the Model or Model/View being Imbedding.js queries (Yeastmine JS api)
The controller is a simple Backbone routing object.

No provision is made for WRITING to the database, although the "VC" nature (with CRU routes) should be adaptable to a R/W model (i.e, SGD Oracle database - perhaps with a python wrapper)
 

minimal templates needed:
-header (including nav bar and search box)
-footer
-table (should be provided by imtables or datatables via YeastMine)
-Further Analysis (send lists to Intermine/Other Apps, or replaced with YM widgets like GO analysis.

This list could be expanded to create other SGD pages
